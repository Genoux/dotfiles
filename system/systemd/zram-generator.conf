# ZRAM Configuration for Compressed Swap
# This provides faster swap using compressed RAM instead of disk
# Improves performance on systems with limited RAM (especially laptops)
#
# Installation:
# sudo cp ~/dotfiles/system/systemd/zram-generator.conf /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# sudo systemctl start systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service
# sudo systemctl enable systemd-zram-setup@zram0.service

[zram0]
# Size: Use half of total RAM for ZRAM
# With compression, this effectively gives you ~1.5-2x more swap space
# Example: 8GB RAM = 4GB ZRAM, which compresses to ~8-12GB usable swap
zram-size = ram / 2

# Compression algorithm
# zstd = best balance of speed and compression ratio
# lz4 = faster but less compression (use for very old systems)
compression-algorithm = zstd

# Swap priority (higher = used first)
# 100 = use ZRAM before any disk-based swap
swap-priority = 100

# Filesystem type
fs-type = swap
